.SH NAME
dssi_osc_update
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dssi_osc_update
.I <OSC URL>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dssi_osc_update
sends a DSSI `update' OSC request to a DSSI host, then waits for OSC
responses from the host, writes any responses received to stdout,
and exits when it has not received anything for five seconds.  DSSI
hosts should respond to an `update' request by sending the complete
state of the plugin; this program can be used to retrieve and
display that state.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B <OSC URL>
The URL specifying the host and plugin, to which the request is sent.
This is typically obtained from the host, perhaps from startup
messages or the host's `About' dialog. For example:
  osc.udp://localhost:19383/dssi/test.1
  osc.udp://my.host.org:10886/dssi/xsynth-dssi/Xsynth/chan00
