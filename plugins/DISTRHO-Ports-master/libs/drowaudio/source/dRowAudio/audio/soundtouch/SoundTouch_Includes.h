/// SoundTouch - main class for tempo/pitch/rate adjusting routines. 
///
/// Notes:
/// - Initialize the SoundTouch object instance by setting up the sound stream 
///   parameters with functions 'setSampleRate' and 'setChannels', then set 
///   desired tempo/pitch/rate settings with the corresponding functions.
///
/// - The SoundTouch class behaves like a first-in-first-out pipeline: The 
///   samples that are to be processed are fed into one of the pipe by calling
///   function 'putSamples', while the ready processed samples can be read 
///   from the other end of the pipeline with function 'receiveSamples'.
/// 
/// - The SoundTouch processing classes require certain sized 'batches' of 
///   samples in order to process the sound. For this reason the classes buffer 
///   incoming samples until there are enough of samples available for 
///   processing, then they carry out the processing step and consequently
///   make the processed samples available for outputting.
/// 
/// - For the above reason, the processing routines introduce a certain 
///   'latency' between the input and output, so that the samples input to
///   SoundTouch may not be immediately available in the output, and neither 
///   the amount of outputtable samples may not immediately be in direct 
///   relationship with the amount of previously input samples.
///
/// - The tempo/pitch/rate control parameters can be altered during processing.
///   Please notice though that they aren't currently protected by semaphores,
///   so in multi-thread application external semaphore protection may be
///   required.
///
/// - This class utilizes classes 'TDStretch' for tempo change (without modifying
///   pitch) and 'RateTransposer' for changing the playback rate (that is, both 
///   tempo and pitch in the same ratio) of the sound. The third available control 
///   'pitch' (change pitch but maintain tempo) is produced by a combination of
///   combining the two other controls.
