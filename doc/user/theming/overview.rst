Theming
=======
Zrythm aims to allow extensive theming support. You can override
many defaults that Zrythm uses by placing things in your
Zrythm user directory. This directory can be found in the
:ref:`preferences` and will be referred to as
`the Zrythm directory` in this chapter.

The `Zrythm installation directory` refers to where Zrythm
was installed in. This is normally
``/usr`` on GNU/Linux,
``C:\Program Files\Zrythm`` on Windows and
``Resources`` under the the Application contents on MacOS.
