Overview
========

The Zrythm interface is split into various
sub-modules.

.. image:: /_static/img/user-interface-annotated.png

Each sub-module is explained in its own section.

* :ref:`main-toolbar` (1)
* :ref:`main-panel` (2)
* :ref:`left-panel` (3)
* :ref:`bottom-panel` (4)
* :ref:`right-panel` (5)
* :ref:`transport-bar` (6)

Panels contain multiple *views*, each of which is
made visible by clicking on its corresponding tab.

Detaching Views
---------------
Views in each panel are detachable. To
detach a view into its own separate window,
click and drag its tab outside the main window
of Zrythm.
