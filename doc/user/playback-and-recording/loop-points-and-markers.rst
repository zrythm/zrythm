The song start marker signifies the position
in the timeline where the Song will start.
This is mainly used for exporting the mixdown
into audio.

The song end marker signifies the position
in the timeline where the Song will end.
Likewise, it is mainly used for exporting the
mixdown into audio.

These markers are part of the
:ref:`Marker Track <tracks/track-types:Marker Track>`.

Custom Markers
--------------
Custom Markers can also be created inside the
:ref:`Marker Track <tracks/track-types:Marker Track>`.

   :align: center

These can be used to jump to when moving
forwards or backwards, and are also generally
useful visually to see where each part of the
song begins and ends.
