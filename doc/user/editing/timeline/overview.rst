Overview
========
Editing in the timeline is the most common workflow
inside Zrythm. The timeline section consists of the
tracklist on the left and the ruler/arranger on the
right, along with a timeline-specific toolbar at the
top.

.. _tracklist:

Tracklist
---------

The Tracklist contains all of the Tracks in the
project. It is split into the top (pinned)
Tracklist and the bottom (main) Tracklist.

At the top of the tracklist, the number of visible tracks
over the number of total tracks is shown, as well as
a search box for searching tracks by name (not
operational at the moment).

You can pin tracks to make them stick to the top, and
this is useful for chord progressions and markers,
so you can always see them.

The rest of the tracklist is briefly touched upon in
:ref:`tracklist`.

For more details about track operations, see the :ref:`tracks`
section.

Minimap
-------
The timeline minimap is a little box that represents the
current visible area of the timeline. It can be moved around
and resized to change the visible area.

The rest of the timeline elements are explained in the
following sections.
