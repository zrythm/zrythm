Monitor Section
===============
The monitor section is used to edit global settings
related to mixing and routing signals. It is found
inside the
:ref:`Right Panel <zrythm-interface/right-panel:Right Panel>`.

Monitor Out
-----------
In Zrythm, what you actually hear through your speakers is
not the output of the master track, but the monitor
output.

The master track routes its output to a special processor
called `Monitor Out` that changes the volume before sending
the output to the speakers.
