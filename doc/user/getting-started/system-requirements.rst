System Requirements
===================

Hardware
--------
- x86_64 (64-bit), i686 (32-bit), armhf (ARMv7) or aarch64 (ARMv8)

Operating System
----------------
- GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, Windows or MacOS

Recommendations
---------------

CPU

  least 2GHz clock speed and at least 4 cores in total.
Monitor
  It is recommended to have at least 16 inches of monitor space
  to work efficiently with Zrythm.
Audio interface

  integrated sound cards (especially if recording audio).
MIDI keyboard

JACK
----
When using the JACK backend, JACK needs to be set up and configured
before running Zrythm. You will find lots of information
online about how to configure JACK, such as
`Demystifying JACK - A Beginners Guide to Getting Started with JACK <https://libremusicproduction.com/articles/demystifying-jack-%E2%80%93-beginners-guide-getting-started-jack.html>`_,
so we will skip this part.
